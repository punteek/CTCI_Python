    "# along with the size of each array. Allow for all the normal operations on a stack where the implementation uses\n",
    "# an array (push adds to the first non-empty index at the end of the subarray, pop removes the element at the end\n",
    "# of the array, peek only allows looking at the end of the array). If any push would cause a subarray to exceed max\n",
    "# capacity, create a new array with double the space, create new partition sizes and indices, and copy over all of\n",
    "# the data. Could also implement compaction logic that would resize the array smaller if it becomes very large and then\n",
    "# a lot of data is popped out of the stacks\n",

    "# Keep a member of the stack class called minStack which tracks the minimum element. When a push operation occurs,\n",
